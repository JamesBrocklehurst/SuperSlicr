-- Installation --

Drag and drop the superslicr2.atn file onto your Photoshop application icon.

If this does not work, choose 'Load Actions' from the Actions Palette Contextual Menu and browse for the file.


-- Usage --

(1) Either select the layers or create a rectangular marque for the image that you wish to export
(2) Select the relevant export option (see below) from the SuperSlicr actions in the actions palette.
(3) Run the action.
(4) Check the export settings.
(5) Name and save the image in the usual way.


-- Options --

- Layers to 'JPEG (High)' will trim the selected layers to their pixel bounds and flatten them against your current background colour.

- Layers to 'PNG-24 Standard' will trim the selected layers to their pixel bounds and place them against a transparent background.

- Layers to 'PNG-24 iOS Scaling' will do the same as 'Standard' except it will generate both a standard and 'Retina' version of the image.*

- Selection to 'JPEG (High)' will crop to the selected area and flatten the results against your current background colour.

- Selection to 'PNG-24 Standard' will crop to the selected area and place the results against a transparent background.

- Selection to 'PNG-24 iOS Scaling' will do the same as 'Standard' except it will generate both a standard and 'Retina' version of the image.*

* It is important to note that the action assumes that the original file has been created to Retina proportions, as it performs a scale-down rather than scale-up.
